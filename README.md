# Introduction
A try at making logging in bash easier. Trying to mimic some log4j functionalities like formatting, text coloring, log level, etc...

# Usage

```
source ./scripts/log4bash
log_trace "this is a trace"
log_debug "this is a debug"
log_info "this is a info"
log_warning "this is a warning"
log_error "this is a error"
log_fatal "this is a fatal"
```
